# Reviews_ChatGPT-Analysis-Python-RJ
📝 Review Sentiment Analysis with Python & NLP
📌 Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis and keyword extraction on user-generated reviews using Python. The reviews are pulled from a Google Sheet, analyzed using TextBlob, NLTK, and Seaborn, and visualized using word clouds and charts.

The notebook-style script was developed using Google Colab, and follows prompt-based instructions, often aligned with ChatGPT guidance, to build a complete NLP analysis pipeline.
